Since I want to keep growing as a game programmer and I learnt so much during this past year, I decided to use my acquired knowledge and some extra resources to develop another game engine.

You may ask: Why another game engine? Well, since I have learned so much since then, I really am not feeling like my previous game engine reflects the way I work anymore.

For the development of this project, I am going to use part of the knowledge I acquired from following sources:

- Masters degree in Video game Programming:
https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/201200/master-advanced-programming-aaa-video-games/

Some of the beautiful helpful books from Scott Meyers, such as Effective C++

And the extremely interesting and complete project called handmade hero that I would recommend to every programmer.

If along the way I find other sources of knowledge, I will keep this updated.
